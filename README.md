Learn Go in OpenVE

# Current Projects in this Repo:

- A folder of Algorithms.
- VEbot: OpenVE's bot written in Go.
- copy: A simple tool to copy files with a loading status bar.

# How to install them

Make a directory called `OpenVE` inside your `src` folder in your Go
file structure, then link that directory with this repo, as follows:

```
$ cd OpenVE
$ git init
$ git remote add origin git://github.com/OpenVE/Go.git
```

Right then you can install the programs and projects this way:

```
go install OpenVE/copy
```

(Above, I used the project `copy` as an example).

Remember to submit your issues in the issues page.

Each project has it's own licenses, go check inside them.

Thank you.
